// Weight Value Tool Definition
// This tool calculates the value of a specific weight of precious metal

  description: `Calculate the current value of a specific weight/amount of precious metal.

PRIMARY USE CASE - Use this tool when users ask:
- "How much is [X]g/oz/kg of [metal] worth?"
- "What's the value of [X] grams of [metal]?"
- "How much is my [X]g of [karat] gold worth?"
- "Calculate the value of [X] ounces of silver"
- Any variation asking for the monetary value of a specific weight of metal

This tool will:
1. Automatically fetch the current spot price for the metal
2. Use the appropriate price per unit (price_gram_24k, price_gram_18k, etc.)
3. Calculate the total value (weight Ã— price)
4. Return the complete result with breakdown

DO NOT use get_spot_price + calculate separately for these queries. Use this tool instead.`,
